# 0x11. C - printf

## Overview
Welcome to our group project! In this repository, we aim to implement our own version of the `printf` function in the C programming language. Below are the requirements and guidelines for the project:

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the following options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, located at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Code should follow the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- Global variables are not allowed
- Each file should contain no more than 5 functions
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file `main.h`
- Header files should be include guarded to prevent multiple inclusion

### Testing
- Example `main.c` files are provided for testing purposes. You can use them to test your functions, but they are not required to be pushed to your repository. Our own `main.c` files will be used during compilation, which may differ from the examples provided.

## Let's Get Started!
Feel free to explore the project and contribute your ideas and code. Together, we can create a robust and efficient implementation of the `printf` function in C.
